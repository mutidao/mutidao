- 👋 Hi, we're @mutidao
- 👀 We're a DAO and physical collective that has been founded to support artists and their daily needs.
- 🌱 We're bridging the digital with the physical and are learning new ways on how to do so every month.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative projects and also on developing a service DAPP so that artists can buy materials with crypto/NEAR instead of fiat.
- 📫 contact us via muti.collective@gmail.com
